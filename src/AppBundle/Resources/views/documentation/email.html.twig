    <h1>Email</h1>

    <p>Emails are handled by the email service.  We use swiftmailer and a smtp server to send the mail.
        I recommend you use a service and not roll out your own because setting up an email server is a pain the ass.
        The only thing besides swiftmailer you will have to fill out is the from_email parameter.
    </p>
