    <p>
        Registration will authenticate the user via session.  It will act pretty much like login does.  Registration is handle by the <a href="https://github.com/phptuts/symfonystarter/blob/master/src/CoreBundle/Service/User/RegisterService.php#L78">register service</a>.
        This will encode the user's plain password and send a out a generic email.  The parameter from from_email is where from address comes from.  Notice that the register service will mark the user registered via website if they are coming in from the website.
